# CS340-2024C-6 Project Two

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

- I write maintainable programs by keeping the code modular with using clear variable and method names and adding comments for clarity. In the CRUD Python module, I used object oriented programming to separate functionalities like creating and reading data into different methods. This made the code easy to reuse and update especially when connecting it to the dashboard in Project Two. 

## What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

- Reusing the CRUD module saved time and made the code easy to understand. Each function was clearly defined which made updates and expansions simple. The module is also scalable and can be used for other tasks like managing user accounts or tracking inventory. 

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

- I break problems into smaller tasks and tackle them step by step. For Grazioso Salvare, I created the CRUD module to handle database operations and connected it to a dashboard for data visualization. This project was more complex than others because it required integrating multiple parts and meeting client needs. In the future, Iâ€™ll continue using this methodical approach and tools like automated testing to ensure reliability.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

- Computer scientists solve problems by creating tools that improve efficiency. For example, my CRUD module and dashboard helped Grazioso Salvare manage animal shelter data which let them focus on adoptions and care. This shows how software can directly help organizations achieve their goals and work more effectively.
